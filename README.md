# RS9
RS9 is a Discord (and maybe Telegram who knows) bot that grabs TikToks.

## Installation
You just have to supply either an envvar or a .env file that contains the variable `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` set to your bot token.
There's also a Docker container you can build to run the bot

## Usage
You either paste a TikTok link in the bot's DMs or in a channel it can see so it deletes your message and embeds your TikTok or you can use the `/tiktok <url>` slash command.
